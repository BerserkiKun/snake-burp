## 🎯 Overview
**snake-burp** is a fully playable Snake game that runs inside Burp Suite! Take a break from security testing and enjoy some nostalgic gaming directly in your favorite web security tool.

## ✨ Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay** - Control a snake, eat food, grow longer, avoid colliding with yourself
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels** - Easy (200ms), Medium (130ms), Hard (75ms) base speeds
- **Wrap Mode Toggle** - Screen wrapping for endless movement or wall collision for classic mode
- **Progressive Difficulty** - Game speeds up every 5 food items (minimum 40ms interval)
- **High Score Tracking** - Persists during the session
- **Visual Polish** - Smooth rendering with directional snake eyes, fading body segments, glowing food
- **Keyboard Controls** - Multiple key bindings for convenience
- **Burp Theme Compatible** - Dark color scheme that fits Burp Suite's aesthetic

## 🎯 Why?

Because even security researchers need a break sometimes! Plus, it demonstrates how to build a complete, interactive game as a Burp extension with proper separation of concerns, event handling, and UI rendering.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Burp Suite Community/Professional Edition

### Quick Install (Pre-built JAR)
1. Download the latest `snake-burp-v1.0.0.jar` from the [Releases](https://github.com/berserkikun/snake-burp/releases) page
2. Open Burp Suite → Extender → Extensions
3. Click "Add"
4. Set Extension Type to "Java"
5. Select the downloaded JAR file
6. Click "Next" to load

### Build from Source

#### Using the Build Script (macOS/Linux)
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# Run the build script
./build.sh

# The JAR will be in target/snake-burp-v1.0.0.jar
```

The build script automatically:
- Locates your Burp Suite installation
- Compiles all Java files
- Creates the JAR with proper manifest
- Provides loading instructions

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Move Up | ↑ or W |
| Move Down | ↓ or S |
| Move Left | ← or A |
| Move Right | → or D |
| Pause/Resume | P or ESC |
| Restart | R |
| Start/Restart | ENTER (when game not running) |

### Game Rules
- Control the snake to eat the red food pellets
- Each food increases your score and snake length
- Game ends if you collide with yourself
- Toggle "Wrap Mode" to wrap around screen edges instead of dying
- Game speed increases every 5 food items eaten

### Interface
- **Top Bar**: Score, high score, speed level, difficulty selector, wrap mode toggle, support button
- **Game Board**: 40×25 grid with smooth rendering
- **Overlays**: Clear visual feedback for waiting, paused, and game over states

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles:

```
BurpExtender (Entry Point)
    ↓
SnakeTab (UI Container) ←→ GameEngine (Game Logic)
    ↓                          ↓
SnakeGamePanel (Renderer) ←→ Snake/Food/Point (Models)
    ↓
InputHandler (Key Events)
```

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **BurpExtender** | Burp integration entry point |
| **SnakeTab** | Main UI container implementing Burp's ITab |
| **GameEngine** | Pure game logic with no UI dependencies |
| **SnakeGamePanel** | Custom rendering component |
| **InputHandler** | Keyboard input processing |
| **Model Classes** | Snake, Food, Point, enums for game state |

### Design Highlights
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between logic, UI, and input
- **Event-Driven** - Game loop driven by Swing Timer, UI updates via listener pattern
- **Immutability** - Point class is immutable for safe sharing
- **Input Buffering** - Direction changes queued to prevent illegal moves
- **Performance** - O(1) collision detection using HashSet

## 📊 Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Grid Size | 40 columns × 25 rows |
| Cell Size | 24×24 pixels |
| Board Size | 960×600 pixels |
| Speed Progression | +1 level every 5 food items, -10ms interval |
| Minimum Speed | 40ms (capped) |
| Difficulty Levels | Easy (200ms), Medium (130ms), Hard (75ms) |
